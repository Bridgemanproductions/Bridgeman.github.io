        <strong>Another Open Sidewalks/"Mapping Party"</strong>
    </div>
    <br> 
    <p>
        In this post I will discuss another meeting I had with code for the Carolinas. 
        Code for the Carolinas for those unaware is a Civic Tech volunteer organization 
        with a mission to use technology for the people of the Carolinas, in service of 
        more equitable and just communities.
        <br>
        <br>
        Code for the Carolinas have weekly meetings to discuss the goals of the organization and to have "mapping Parties‚Äù. 
        Each meeting starts the same, we begin with an ice breaker, discuss the leaders of the presentations, and then break out into groups, 
        and at the end we come back together and share what we have learned and say our goodbyes. The ice breakers are very simple. 
        We take turns introducing ourselves and then answer the ice breaker question for that day. Usually a fun question to get new comers as well as regulars to open up and share about themselves. 
        After the icebreaker and introductions are finished we introduce who will be leading the second group.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then we split into two groups. One group is for newcomers to learn more about the project. 
        The second group is for regulars that already know about the project. Since I am a regular I stay with the main group and begin to start on our task.
        Code with the Carolinas is currently working on  two projects: Open sidewalks project and the Zoning atlas project. Each project is done differently. 
        The open sidewalks project uses an open source platform of the same name to allow us to update map information using GPS data. All the map information is public and can be edited at any time. 
        Once a change is made depending on the map you can see the updated change immediately or after it has been reviewed by the admin for that map. There are multiple maps to choose from covering a variety of locations around the world. 
        The maps that we are most interested in are the eastern carolina maps. When opening a map you will see the location sectioned off into multiple zones. 
        You will choose the zone you are looking to edit and then begin to look for necessary changes. What Code for the Carolinas is focused on is updating the curbs and road crossings found on the eastern carolina maps.
        Once changes are being done to a zone the color will change to indicate that it is being worked on.Code with the Carolinas also has a map of downtown Raleigh that Code with the Carolinas is working to complete.

        The Open sidewalks website is very easy to use and provides you with a step by step tutorial on how to use the platform's features. 
        Open sidewalks provide tools to identify objects and buildings, categorize different curb types, identify roads, leave comments on updated work, and many other features. 
        As I mentioned Code for the Carolinas is focused on updating the curbs and road crossings found on the eastern carolina maps. When I begin to make changes the first thing I do is look to see how much has been edited already. 
        So maps will have a lot of work already done so you have to find sections of the zone that haven't been updated yet. Once I find a section I believe needs updating I open the pdf rule book the Open side walks provides to make sure that my edits fall within the guidelines. 
        After the edit has been made I will add a note detailing what I have added and if there is anything else that needs to be checked. If the zone looks very thoroughly edited I will make a comment stating as much so an admin can clear it for completion.
