                This post I will be discussing an in person I attend at my school East Carolina University called employer in the foyer. 
                This is an event that is held very often on campus in a building named Bate. 
                The Bate building is ECUâ€™s school of business department building for the school as most classes related to business will be held there. 
                In the lobby of Bate different employers will come and set up a booth to display their company. 
                Students can come and ask questions about the employers and turn in their resume.
                <br>
                <br>
                The event was held from 9 am to 12 pm so it is very brief but I made sure to be the first in attendance. 
                There were three booths available and the companies that came were Captrust, Gregory Poole, and Blackman & Sloop. 
                Gregory Pool is an equipment company for CAT tools they handle the buying and distribution of their products. 
                I spoke with David, a representative of the company about their use of data analytics. We talked about job expectations,what tools and skill sets will be needed for working for their company, 
                and if there were any open positions in the summer. The main tools they use and would like you to be adept in are excel and microsoft power bi. 
                These are two tools that I am currently working with and becoming more familiar with as my time at ECU is almost to a close.

                The other company I took an interest in was Captrust, they are a financial advice company based in Raleigh. I spoke with their representative James about job expectations, open positions in the summer,
                 the location of the job itself, and the tools and skill set needed to work for their company. 
                During our conversation we talked about having an adept skill set with excel and James asked me about my experience with excel and what makes me think that I am proficient. 
                That question caught me off guard and I wasn't sure of a good example to use. 
                I talked about an assignment I had for a class using excel but I wish I had a better example to show him. I was able to give him my resume and get his business card so I can reach out to him in future.

                I did mention my coding skill set as I had to use them to make this portfolio. I feel that this was a really good experience for me because I got to speak directly with employers and see what skills and systems I should be the most comfortable with before I finish school. 
                It also made me reevaluate my portfolio and what projects I want to add to showcase my Data analyst skill set. I want to add an excel project to my portfolio to show my excel skill as well as add all the projects I have from this semester to the portfolio.
                I want to have more examples of the dashboards I have made in microsoft power bi and tableau as well. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have three projects I am currently working on and I can't wait to have them all online and accessible to employers.
